title: Great bike shops

This page is about the bike shops that I've been frequenting

# Curbside Cycle

[Curbside Cycle](https://curbsidecycle.com/) is probably my favorite bike store, and everyone seems to have great things to say about them. They are located in Toronto, but have a great website. I'm a bit biased though, as it's powered by my employer - Shopify. This was a pleasant surprise to me, as I literally just stumbled across it when looking to buy a Brompton. Amazingly fast shipping, very friendly and stupendously helpful staff.

# Tall Tree Cycles

[Tall Tree Cycles](http://talltreecycles.ca/) is a nice local bike shop. Very funny owners and staff, very friendly. I haven't given the shop as much patronage as I should, but I plan to lean on them for any special tune-ups, maintenance, and to inspect any work I've done myself if I'm unsure of it.

# Full cycle

[Full cycle](http://fullcycle.ca/) is a shop I've never been to, but the staff seem friendly from e-mail correspondance. I'm looking into getting a bunch of folks together to do their [bike maintenance courses](http://fullcycle.ca/bike-mechanics-courses/)

# Fosters

[Foster's Sports](http://www.fosterssports.ca/) is the closest bike shop to me (just a few blocks away). I mostly pop in here for convenience items. I wouldn't really recommend them for anything other than the convenience of if you're already close by. They aren't particularly friendly or helpful here, the selection isn't terribly good, and I've had a couple of botched tune-ups. If you're in a pinch though, they can be really convenient. Don't go out of your way to go here though.
