# My Brompton

She's a main focus of this blog, and my original reason for starting it.

My Brompton is a white P6R to which I have made the following modifications (so far):

* [Brooks B17 saddle](/brompton-zero-day-brooks/)
* Brompton cover attached to saddle
* Brompton rack sack for the panier
* Schmidt hub dynamo with LED light
* Road morph G pump, zip-tied to panier
* Abus bordo granit x-plus 6500

Some additional mods I'm considering:

* Some [brooks leather handle bar tape](https://curbsidecycle.com/products/brooks-perforated-leather-handlebar-tape?variant=16216406211) - I have a bit of hand pain sometimes, so this with some gel pads would be very welcome.
* A [nicer hub shifter](https://curbsidecycle.com/products/sturmey-archer-sls30-thumb-shifter), because the plastic one it comes with feels shoddy.
* Some [winter tires](https://curbsidecycle.com/products/marathon-winter-spike-tire), if I decide to ride in winter

# My (girlfriend's) Raleigh Twenty

Still a work in progress, I'm [refitting an old twenty](/the-raleigh-project/) to bring some shine back to this classic beauty.
