title: Other great sites and blogs

I've come across quite a few sites that I think deserve a callout for their great content and posts. Many of these have been a tremendous help, and wonderful wells of experience to draw from

# Bromptoning

![bromptoning](/images/bromptoning.png)

[Bromptoning](http://bromptoning.com/) is a bike blog specifically about the journeys and experiences of two friendly Torontonians with their Bromptons. They travel a lot, and bring their Brompton's everywhere! If you read their blog, you'll discover that they bought their Bromptons originally as a traveling accessory because they enjoyed the bike rental program in Montreal so much, and wanted to experience biking in other cities that didn't offer this.

Some of their posts that I have really liked are:

* [Packing Bromptons for air travel](http://bromptoning.com/traveling-adventures/packing-the-bromptons-for-air-travel/), I modified their approach a bit in [my own post](/flying-with-brompton/) to use bubble wrap instead of cardboard.
* [Flying WestJet with a Brompton](http://bromptoning.com/traveling-adventures/bromptons-like-flying-westjet/), since I fly WestJet more than any other airline.
* [Experiences flying Porter with a Brompton](http://bromptoning.com/traveling-adventures/flying-porter-with-a-bike/), since I tend to fly Porter a fair bit for work.
* [Their chronicles of a recent trip to Ottawa](http://bromptoning.com/traveling-adventures/ottawa/bromptoning-in-ottawa/) because I live in Ottawa and found it really neat to know other Bromptoners had been zooming about!
* [Their bio](http://bromptoning.com/about-us/) I think their story is really cool!

Love this blog over all, definitely going to keep an eye on it. Thanks much Pier & Heather!!! Keep the posts coming.

# My Orange Brompton

[My Orange Brompton](http://www.myorangebrompton.com/) is a blog that has recently moved to [a new home](http://www.adventuresbybicycle.com/) that is less Brompton-centric. I haven't given the new site much of a look-over, but the original is a wealth of neat information about Brompton bikes and cycling in the UK.

* [A detailed description of his bike](http://www.myorangebrompton.com/2014/08/asi-am-sure-you-are-aware-i-have-new.html), if you haven't noticed my own P6R is almost identical to his - and that's no accident!

# Brompton BumbleB

I really like this guy's blog. This post, and the post on Orange Brompton were key factors in me deciding to get a Schmidt hub. He's also got a great sense of humor, and the blog reads pretty easily.

* [Description of experience with a Schmidt hub - let there be light!](http://www.bromptonbumbleb.com/2014/10/let-there-be-light.html)
* Several other great posts about rides he has been on (too many to list here). He seems to do a lot of group rides - looks like fun!!! Check them out!

# Reckless Experimentation

[Reckless Experimentation](http://recklessexperimentation.blogspot.ca/) is a blog that I've only really read a single post off of, but really enjoyed it.

* [First Impressions of the Brompton Bicycle](http://recklessexperimentation.blogspot.ca/2012/05/first-impressions-of-brompton-bicycle.html) is a great article about the author's discovery of a Brompton bike while traveling, and the progression of him falling in love and purchasing his own. I really like this article because the guy is from Vancouver, and has a unique perspective given the very hilly terrain.
