title: Useful bike resources

This page covers a bunch of really useful bike resources I've come across.

# General knowledge

## Sheldon Brown

Perhaps the most useful site is is [the late Sheldon Brown's](www.sheldonbrown.com). He was a life-long bike addict who ran his own [bike shop](http://harriscyclery.net/), and chronicled an absurdb amount of bike knowledge online. I view him as the 'wise old sysadmin' equivalent for bicycles.

Unfortunately, he lost his battle with MS several years ago. His wife and friends run the site still though, and keep it updated.
